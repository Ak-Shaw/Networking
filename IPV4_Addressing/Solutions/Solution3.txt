Each question is worth 2 points:

Question 1: In the IPv4 addressing format, the number of networks allowed under Class C addresses is
Answer:
In class C, 8 bits are reserved for Host Id and 24 bits are reserved for Network Id. 
Out of these 24 Network Id bits, the leading 3 bits are fixed as 110. 
So remaining 21 bits can be used for different networks.


Question 2: If a class B network on the Internet has a subnet mask of 255.255.248.0, what is the maximum number of hosts per subnet?
Answer:
The binary representation of subnet mask is 11111111.11111111.11111000.00000000. 
There are 21 bits set in subnet. So 11 (32-21) bits are left for host ids. 
Total possible values of host ids is 2^11 = 2048. Out of these 2048 values, 2 addresses are reserved.
The address with all bits as 1 is reserved as broadcast address and address with all host id bits as 0 is used as network address of subnet.

Question 3: The default subnet mask for a class A network can be
Answer: 255.0.0.0
