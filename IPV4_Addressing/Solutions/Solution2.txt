Question 1 and 2 is worth 1 point, Question 3 is worth 2 points.

Question 1: Given the IP address 144.56.34.78 and the subnet mask 255.255.255.0, what is network address?
Answer: 
255.255.255.0 in binary representation is 11111111.11111111.11111111.00000000
144.56.34.78 in binary representation is  10010000.00111000.00100010.01001110
Anding the above two values, we get : 144.56.34.0 which is the network address

Question 2: Given the IP address 101.156.234.178 and the subnet mask 255.0.0.0, what is network address?
Answer: Convert the Ip address and the subnet to binary representation.AND it.

We get, 101.0.0.0 which is the network address.

Question 3:Given the IP address 101.156.234.178 and the subnet mask 255.255.128.0, what is network address?
Answer: 
255.255.128.0 in binary representation is   11111111.11111111.11111111.10000000
101.156.234.178 in binary representation is 01100101.10011100.11101010.01001110
ANDing the above 2 values we get :          01100101.10011100.11101010.00000000
which when represented in decimal is 101.156.234.0
