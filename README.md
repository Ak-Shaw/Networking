# Introduction

A network consists of multiple devices that communicate with one another.  It can be as small as two [computers](https://techterms.com/definition/computer) or as large as billions of devices.  While a traditional network is comprised of [desktop computers](https://techterms.com/definition/desktop_computer), modern networks may include [laptops](https://techterms.com/definition/laptop), [tablets](https://techterms.com/definition/tablet), [smartphones](https://techterms.com/definition/smartphone), televisions, gaming consoles, smart appliances, and other electronics.

Many types of networks exist, but they fall under two primary categories: [LANs](https://techterms.com/definition/lan) and [WANs](https://techterms.com/definition/wan).

### Background

A **computer network** is a group of [computers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer) that use a set of common [communication protocols](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Communication_protocol) over [digital](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_signal) interconnections for the purpose of sharing resources located on or provided by the [network nodes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Node_(networking)). The interconnections between nodes are formed from a broad spectrum of [telecommunication network](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telecommunication_network) technologies, based on physically wired, optical, and wireless radio-frequency methods that may be arranged in a variety of [network topologies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_topology).
